Have you ever played a Cat and Mouse game... in space?

- Cat Mode: You’re the hunter. Track your opponent through the void, anticipate their moves, and strike before they escape. Every second counts. Every maneuver could be your last.
- Mouse Mode: You’re the prey. Evade, outsmart, and survive. Your only goal: stay alive as long as possible while the hunter closes in.
- Local Multiplayer: 2 players over Wi-Fi (LAN or Wi-Fi Direct)
- Fast-paced arcade action with minimal setup
